                Diogenes is the mostly silent protagonist of Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. His character references the ancient 
                Greek philosopher Diogenes, a man who would often sleep in a pot in the marketplace of Athens as a protest against Greek 
                society. Similarly, Getting Over It's Diogenes lives with half of his body inside of a black metal cauldron. He wields an 
                oversized orange Yosemite hammer to help him scale the various obstacles up the mountain.
